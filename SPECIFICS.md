Os2Display for Ballerup
===

## Updating from the main Os2Display project
This repository is a fork of https://github.com/os2display/admin but development by Reload is done in the reload-repo branch of this repository and when updates are pulled in, the Reload fork of the main project is just pulled into the reload-repo branch like this:
```
git pull https://github.com/reload/os2display-admin.git reload-develop
```
All this confusion is because Github only allows one remote fork.
